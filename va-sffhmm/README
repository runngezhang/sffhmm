This archive contains the python software for the article 

Jean-Louis Durrieu and Jean-Philippe Thiran,
"Source/Filter Factorial Hidden Markov Model, 
with Application to Pitch and Formant Tracking", 
submitted in Jan. 2013, accepted July 2013.

INSTALL:
--------

No installation is required. There are however a few dependencies to be 
satisfied before being able to use the programs. In particular:

  * Hillenbrand dataset (if reproducing the results - see article for details)
  * Matplotlib (if displaying results is desired)
  * Numpy
  * scikits.learn (v0.8, 0.9, 0.10 or 0.11, not sure for higher versions)
  * Scipy

USAGE:
------

In order to fit a Source/Filter FHMM on a given signal, one can refer to 
the provided `test_sffhmm.py`. 

In order to partly reproduce the results of the article, the ones concerning
the Hillenbrand dataset, one can refer to the script `sffhmm_hill_batch.py`. 


FILES:
------
In details, it contains the following files:
  * README
      this file
  * computeLogDensity_FB_Viterbi.c
      C code for the forward/backward procedure 
  * loadHillenbrand.py
      a script that loads a few variables specific to the Hillenbrand dataset
  * LPCanalysis.py
      functions related with linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis,
      for use to initialize the posterior probability matrices.
  * sffhmm.py 
      python module that extends scikits.learn and implements
      the main functions for the parameter estimation of the SFFHMM
      model.
  * sffhmm_hill_batch_awgn.py
      script to launch a batch processing for the whole Hillenbrand dataset.
  * sffhmm_vtr_batch_resPerVow.py
      script to launch a batch processing for Deng's dataset.
  * test_sffhmm.py
      An example of how one can use the SFFHMM for a given file.
